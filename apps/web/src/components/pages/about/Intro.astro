    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl">
      We began with a simple truth. Property management is not about buildings. It is about people. In 2010, a small group of professionals looked at the industry and saw
      opportunity where others saw complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our founders understood that every property tells a story. Some are quiet residential blocks. Others are bustling commercial estates. Each requires a unique approach, a
      nuanced understanding of space and human interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      We built Belgarum on principles of transparency and precision. No bureaucratic nonsense. No hidden fees. Just clear, direct communication and strategic management. We
      listened to property owners and residents alike, learning their challenges and developing solutions that truly mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, we transformed from a local startup to a national leader. Our growth was not about size, but about depth of expertise. We invested in technology. We trained
      our team rigorously. We remained committed to our original vision of making property management simple, efficient, and human.
    </p>
    <p>Today, we continue to push boundaries. We are not just managing properties. We are creating environments where people can thrive, invest, and build their futures.</p>
